### Brief

We are going to do the `Transform` step of an Extract-Transform-Load.

### ETL

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) is a fancy way of saying, "We have some crufty, legacy data over in this system, and now we need it in this shiny new system over here, so
we're going to migrate this."

(Typically, this is followed by, "We're only going to need to run this
once." That's then typically followed by much forehead slapping and
moaning about how stupid we could possibly be.)

### The goal

We're going to extract some Scrabble scores from a legacy system.

The old system stored a list of letters per score:

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

The shiny new Scrabble system instead stores the score per letter, which
makes it much faster and easier to calculate the score for a word. It
also stores the letters in lower-case regardless of the case of the
input letters:

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- Etc.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform the legacy data
format to the shiny new format.

### Notes

A final note about scoring, Scrabble is played around the world in a
variety of languages, each with its own unique scoring table. For
example, an "E" is scored at 2 in the Māori-language version of the
game while being scored at 4 in the Hawaiian-language version.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run `pytest etl_test.py`

Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
`python -m pytest etl_test.py`

### Common `pytest` options

- `-v` : enable verbose output
- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure
- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

### Evaluation Criteria

- Python best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes 
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
